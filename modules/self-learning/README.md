# Evolux

Adaptive learning system that evolves through continuous interaction, enabling AI applications to improve their performance over time through experience and feedback.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improves performance through interaction patterns
- **Multi-Domain Intelligence**: Handles coding, reasoning, conversation, and problem-solving
- **Experience-Based Growth**: Learns from both positive and negative feedback
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies and leverages successful interaction patterns
- **Knowledge Retention**: Maintains long-term learning across sessions
- **Performance Optimization**: Self-optimizes based on usage patterns

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install evolux
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prakashgbid/evolux-ai.git
cd evolux-ai
pip install -e .
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

```python
from evolux import LearningEngine
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Initialize the learning engine
    engine = LearningEngine()
    
    # Learn from interactions
    await engine.record_interaction(
        domain="coding",
        input_context="Create a REST API",
        output_response="Here's a Flask REST API...",
        feedback=("positive", 0.9)
    )
    
    # Apply learned patterns to new situations
    recommendations = await engine.apply_learning(
        domain="coding",
        context="Build a web service"
    )
    
    print(f"Learning confidence: {recommendations['confidence']}")
    print(f"Recommendations: {recommendations['suggestions']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🧠 Learning Domains

- **Coding**: Programming patterns, best practices, code optimization
- **Reasoning**: Problem-solving strategies, logical patterns
- **Conversation**: Communication styles, response effectiveness  
- **Knowledge**: Information processing, fact retention
- **Behavior**: System interaction patterns, user preferences

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Evolux tracks various metrics to optimize learning:

- **Interaction Success Rate**: Percentage of successful interactions
- **Learning Velocity**: Speed of adaptation to new patterns
- **Knowledge Retention**: Long-term memory effectiveness
- **Pattern Recognition**: Ability to identify useful patterns
- **Feedback Integration**: How well feedback improves performance

## 🔧 Configuration

```python
config = {
    'learning_rate': 0.1,
    'memory_window': 1000,
    'confidence_threshold': 0.7,
    'domains': ['coding', 'reasoning', 'conversation'],
    'feedback_weight': 0.8
}

engine = LearningEngine(config)
```

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Format code
black src tests

# Lint
