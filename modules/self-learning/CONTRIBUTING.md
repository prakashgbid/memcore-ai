# Contributing to self-learning

We love your input! We want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- We use Black for Python code formatting
- We use flake8 for linting
- Type hints are encouraged

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/
```
